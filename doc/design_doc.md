- Date-Start  : Sep 19, 2019
- BU Course : CS591 P1 OOD

### Assumptions

#### Blackjack assumptions

- Money and bet are all integers.
- One game can hold at most 8 players.
- The number of decks is set to be 1.
- If the optimal score in hand reaches 21, automatically stand.
- For each single game, the pile will be reset and shuffled.

#### Trianta Ena assumptions

- Money and bet are all integers.
- When to set the money for all players, the program will discard all money the players hold ( no matter how much they have ). The first player in the group will automatically be promoted to be the banker.
- One game will hold up to 10 people ( including banker )
- If a banker does not have enough to pay for the money to "WIN" players, for current one game, he will still pay the money and he owns a debt, and each player still gets the money. After the checkpoint of the current game, if the banker still owns a debt. The banker will be downgraded to player and cannot join all next games.
- If a player has 0 money, he is still in the group. But he cannot join all next games.
- If the optimal score in hand reaches 31, automatically stand.
- Banker is set to make option automatically ( If >= 27, stand ).

  - helper functions
  - override functions

### Something relating Blackjack improved during making Trianta Ena

- Create Name [ class ]
- Create Money [ class ]
- Add something to Card [ class ] to make it print colored string
- Delete something in InterfaceBlackjack [ class ] to make it print less information
